Automated Budget Data Processing and Fund Bucketing

budgetR automates a monthly personal budget that was previously done within Excel and required much many processing of different banking statements, conversion of currencies, and lots of adding/subtracting and referencing other fields. While there are many interesting bank account budgeting softwares, I could not find any that work well across multiple currencies/multiple countries and would easily allow users to manipulate budget areas/split expenses/etc. I decided to write my own as it was quicker than finding a mediocre solution that would likely not be free. 

While the rmd is public, the underlying bank statements are not for obvious reasons. Once the project is to a more stable and useful state, I may create anonymised bank account statements to better demonstrate how the data processing works for anyone wanting to repurpose the code. 

Obviously, budgets are very personal and what works for the creator will work very differently for someone else. I have accounts across multiple countries and in multiple currencies so there will be some errors with numbers overtime as currency convesion rates change from when money was originally budgeted in the past.
